        Hello there! I'm currently wrapping up my Master's in Computer Science at UIUC while working 
        as a Research Assistant on the INCAS project. I have a solid background in full-stack development 
        and a keen interest in information management and distributed computing. 
        <br>
        I worked on several other research projects in my undergraduate study (which you can read about below), 
        and I gained valuable industry experience during an 8-month internship at CCC Intelligent Solutions. 
        <br>
        In my free time, I enjoy assembling metallic models and am diligently trying to improve my speedcubing time 
        â€“ still stuck on the 2-minute mark, but I'm getting there :)
